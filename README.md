# Startpage

This is my startpage that I use on a day-to-day basis. It consists of all the bookmarks I use most often, which it reads from a
json file.

I took inspiration from the people over at [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages) on this venture, go and show them some love!

The files are a bit messy; still working on learning to minify and browserify them.

### Version history:
##### v1.2 (Current)
- Added fade transition effects when the logos for the search bars are changed.

##### v1.1
- Changed the way bookmarks are retireved. They are now fetched from a json file (in the assets folder), and editing the file
will reflect changes on the page.

##### v1.0
- Finished build for deployment. Everything is now working properly on github pages
