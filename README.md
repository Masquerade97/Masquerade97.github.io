My homepage I have developed that I use personally at home.

I know it's messy, but I was too lazy to clean up.

This is my first complete attempt at building a full app using angular 4, so it's a little messy due to the 
javascript files it outputs on building. Once I learn how to do some tree shaking I'll clean this all up.

In the meantime, just enjoy the finished product and don't worry about behind the scenes.
