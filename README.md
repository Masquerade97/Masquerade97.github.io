# Startpage

This is my startpage that I use on a day-to-day basis. It consists of all the bookmarks I use most often, which it reads from a
json file.

I took inspiration from the people over at [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages) on this venture, go and show them some love!

The files are a bit messy; still working on learning to minify and browserify them.
